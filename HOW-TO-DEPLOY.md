## üì§ Deploy to Vercel (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Commit Changes to Git

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in your project folder:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\swptc\Documents\voice-of-voiceless

# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add copyright notices and legal protection"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** Vercel watches your GitHub repository and will automatically deploy.

---

### Step 2: Watch Vercel Deploy (Automatic)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "voice-of-voiceless" project
3. You'll see a new deployment starting
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to complete
5. Look for "Ready" status with a green checkmark

## üéØ Quick Command Reference

# Go to your project folder
cd C:\Users\swptc\Documents\voice-of-voiceless

# Deploy changes (3 commands)
git add .
git commit -m "Your message here"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Git not found" or "command not recognized"

**You need to install Git first:**
1. Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Install with default options
3. Restart PowerShell
4. Try commands again

**OR use GitHub Desktop instead:**
1. Already installed from earlier
2. Easier visual interface
3. No command line needed

### Changes not showing on live site

**Wait a bit:**
- Vercel takes 2-3 minutes to deploy
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

**Still not working?**
1. Check Vercel dashboard for errors
2. Look at deployment logs
3. Verify GitHub repository has your changes

### "Permission denied" or "Authentication failed"

**You need to authenticate Git with GitHub:**

Using HTTPS (easier):
```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```
Then push again - it will ask for GitHub username and password

Using GitHub Desktop (easiest):
- It handles authentication automatically
- Just sign in once
