Inspired by "Death of a Cigarette," where a single Lucky Strike 
cigarette narrates its journey through WWII.

## üí° DOMAIN DECISION - YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL

**Why Skipping Custom Domain is Smart:**

‚úÖ **Save Money Now**
- $0 instead of $10-25/year
- Can add anytime later

‚úÖ **Test Market Fit First**
- See if app resonates with users
- Verify sustainable costs
- Understand actual usage

‚úÖ **Professional Enough**
- `voice-of-voiceless.vercel.app` is clean
- `.vercel.app` is recognized and trusted
- Still has HTTPS and global CDN

‚úÖ **Easy to Upgrade Later**
- Takes 15 minutes to add domain
- Vercel makes it simple
- No disruption to users

**When to Add Custom Domain:**
- If app becomes popular (100+ regular users)
- If you want to print QR codes extensively
- If you're doing major marketing push
- If you want the extra polish

**For now: Focus on content and user experience, not the URL.**
