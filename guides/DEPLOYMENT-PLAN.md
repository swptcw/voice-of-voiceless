## Recommended Production Architecture

### Solution: Serverless with Rate Limiting (Best for Book Launch)

```
User Browser
    ‚Üì
Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
    ‚Üì
Serverless Function (Hidden API Key)
    ‚Üì
Rate Limiter (5 narratives/day per IP)
    ‚Üì
Anthropic API
```

### Cost Protection Strategy

**Free Tier:**
- 5 narratives per day per IP address
- No account required
- Instant access

**Optional Sign-Up Benefits:**
- 10 narratives per day
- Save favorite narratives
- Access to premium templates
- Early access to new features

**Cost Estimates:**
- 100 users/day √ó 3 narratives = 300 requests/day
- ~$6-9/day = $180-270/month
- Manageable for initial launch

## Final Notes

This app is meant to be an extension of "Death of a Cigarette," not a standalone product. The goal is to let readers experience the anthropomorphic narration style firsthand and deepen their connection to the book's themes.

Keep the focus on:
- **Quality over quantity** - Better to have fewer, excellent narratives
- **Book connection** - Always link back to the source material
- **Accessibility** - Make it easy for anyone to try
- **Sustainability** - Keep costs manageable for long-term operation

The app should feel like a gift to readers, not a commercial product. Let it be a creative companion to the book that invites people to see the world through different eyes‚Äîor rather, through the consciousness of silent objects finding their voice.
